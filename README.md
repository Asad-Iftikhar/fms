## Pusher:
- You can get the Pusher Channels PHP library via a composer package called pusher-php-server.`$ composer require pusher/pusher-php-server`
- Or add to `composer.json`:
`"require": {
    "pusher/pusher-php-server": "^7.2"
}`
- Make an account on Pusher https://pusher.com/.
- Use the credentials from your Pusher Channels application to create a new Pusher\Pusher instance.
```sh
Example:
app_id = "1504064"
key = "55c4f792919f9dc8b0fb"
secret = "a3506f210c79b3efebf9"
cluster = "ap2"
```
- Add these credentials in .env file. For Example
```sh
PUSHER_APP_ID=1504064
PUSHER_APP_KEY=55c4f792919f9dc8b0fb
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=a3506f210c79b3efebf9
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=ap2
```
There is another change in .env file and that is `BROADCAST_DRIVER`. Default it is set to `BROADCAST_DRIVER=log` just replace log with `BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher`.

- Execute `php artisan storage:link` for creating symlink in laravel.
